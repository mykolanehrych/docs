### Enable Tool if Relevant

:::important
A Skill may include an associated tool, or it may not require one. When a Skill includes a tool, that tool will be activated and used together with the Skill during execution. If the Skill includes a tool, ensure that the corresponding tool integration (if required) is properly configured.
:::

**How to select tools:**

1. In the **Available Tools** field, select internal CodeMie tools if your skill needs them
2. In the **External tools** field, select third-party tools (MCP servers, etc.)
3. Leave empty if the skill only provides instructions without requiring specific tools

**Example:**

# Azure DevOps Wiki

The **Azure DevOps Wiki** tool lets your CodeMie assistant read, create, modify, search, and manage wiki pages in your Azure DevOps project using natural language.

## Prerequisites

Before adding the Wiki tool to an assistant, set up an AzureDevOps integration in CodeMie. See [Azure DevOps — Configure Integration](./index.md#configure-integration-in-codemie).

## Add Wiki Tool to an Assistant

1. Open **Explore Assistant** and click **Create Assistant** (or edit an existing one).
2. Fill in the assistant details: project, name, description, and system instructions.
3. In the **Tools & Integrations** section, expand **Azure DevOps Wiki**.
4. Select the tools you want to enable (or check **Select all**).
5. In the dropdown, select your AzureDevOps integration alias.
6. Click **Create** or **Save**.

:::tip
Wiki identifiers can be either the wiki ID or the wiki name (e.g., `MyProject.wiki`). Page paths must start from the page level — do not include the `/Overview/Wiki` prefix shown in Azure DevOps breadcrumbs.
:::

## Page Path Format

Azure DevOps wiki page paths follow a hierarchical structure. Use the page hierarchy from your wiki, not the URL:

```
# ✅ Correct — page path
/Architecture/Backend/API-Design

# ❌ Incorrect — includes breadcrumb prefix
/Overview/Wiki/Architecture/Backend/API-Design
```

Use `"/"` as the path for the root page or to list top-level pages.

## Usage Examples

Once the assistant is set up, interact with it using natural language:

**Find a wiki page:**

> "Show me the content of the API Design wiki page under Architecture/Backend"

**Create a new page:**

> "Create a new wiki page called 'Deployment Checklist' under /Operations with the following content: ..."

**Search the wiki:**

> "Search the wiki for pages about authentication"

**Update an existing page:**

> "Update the Onboarding page — add a section about the new SSO setup"

**Move a page:**

> "Move the 'Old Processes' page to the /Archive section"

## Smart Tool Selection

**Smart Tool Selection** is an intelligent feature that automatically selects relevant tools for your assistant based on semantic similarity, configured credentials, and permissions.

### How to Enable

1. Navigate to your assistant's **Create** or **Edit** page
2. Locate the **Smart Tool Selection** toggle
3. Enable or disable based on your needs

![Smart Tool Selection](./images/image78.png)

### Behavior

#### When No Tools Are Pre-selected

The system performs semantic analysis across all registered tools and automatically selects based on:

- **Semantic relevance** to your assistant's purpose and conversations
- **Available credentials** and proper authentication
- **User permissions** and access rights

#### When Tools Are Already Selected

- Smart selection is **limited to your pre-selected tools only**
- Prevents context overload by maintaining a focused tool set
- Provides intelligent selection within your curated tool collection

### Important Considerations

:::warning Workflow Operations

- Workflows always use the legacy/traditional approach
- The Smart Tool Selection toggle **does not affect workflow behavior**
- This ensures workflow consistency and predictable execution
  :::

:::info Context Management
Smart selection prevents LLM context overload and maintains optimal performance by limiting tool scope.
:::

### When to Use Smart Tool Selection

**Enable Smart Tool Selection when:**

- You want automatic, intelligent tool discovery
- Your assistant needs dynamic tool access based on conversation context
- You prefer minimal manual tool configuration

**Keep it Disabled when:**

- You need precise control over tool availability
- You're working with sensitive tools requiring explicit selection
- You prefer the traditional manual approach

# Manual Infrastructure Deployment

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for manually deploying AWS infrastructure using Terraform, offering more control and customization options.

:::info When to Use Manual Deployment
Manual deployment is suitable when you need fine-grained control over each deployment phase, want to customize Terraform configurations, or are integrating with existing infrastructure management workflows.
:::

## Prerequisites

Before starting the deployment, ensure you have completed all requirements from the [Prerequisites](../prerequisites.md) page:

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] **AWS Access**: Programmatic access with IAM permissions
- [ ] **Tools Installed**: Terraform 1.13.5, AWS CLI, kubectl, Helm, gcloud CLI, Docker
- [ ] **AWS Authentication**: Configured AWS credentials and region
- [ ] **Repository Access**: Have access to Terraform and Helm repositories
- [ ] **Network Planning**: Prepared list of allowed networks
- [ ] **Domain Configuration**: Route 53 hosted zone ready

:::warning Authentication Required
You must have configured AWS credentials before starting deployment. Verify with `aws sts get-caller-identity`.
:::

## Deployment Phases

Manual deployment involves three sequential phases:

| Phase                                | Description                                                      | Repository                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Phase 1: IAM Deployer Role**       | Creates IAM role with required permissions for deployment        | [codemie-terraform-aws-iam](https://gitbud.epam.com/epm-cdme/codemie-terraform-aws-iam)                       |
| **Phase 2: State Backend**           | Creates S3 bucket with native locking for Terraform state files  | [codemie-terraform-aws-remote-backend](https://gitbud.epam.com/epm-cdme/codemie-terraform-aws-remote-backend) |
| **Phase 3: Platform Infrastructure** | Deploys EKS, networking, storage, databases, security components | [codemie-terraform-aws-platform](https://gitbud.epam.com/epm-cdme/codemie-terraform-aws-platform)             |

## Phase 1: IAM Deployer Role Creation

The `DeployerRole` AWS IAM role will be used for all subsequent infrastructure deployments and updates.

:::info
The created IAM role contains all required permissions to manage AWS resources for AI/Run CodeMie deployment.
:::

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://gitbud.epam.com/epm-cdme/codemie-terraform-aws-iam.git
cd codemie-terraform-aws-iam
```

2. Review input variables in `codemie-terraform-aws-iam/variables.tf` and create a `terraform.tfvars` file:

```hcl
region             = "us-east-1"
platform_name      = "codemie"
deployer_role_name = "AIRunDeployerRole"

# Optional: IAM Permissions Boundary
iam_permissions_boundary_policy_arn = ""

# Optional: Custom tags
tags = {
  "SysName"     = "AI/Run"
  "Environment" = "Production"
  "Project"     = "AI/Run"
}
```

:::tip Review All Variables
Most variables have sensible defaults. Review `variables.tf` for the complete list of available configuration options.
:::

3. Initialize and apply Terraform:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## Phase 2: Terraform Backend Resources Deployment

This phase creates:

- S3 bucket with policy to store terraform states and native S3 locking enabled

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://gitbud.epam.com/epm-cdme/codemie-terraform-aws-remote-backend.git
cd codemie-terraform-aws-remote-backend
```

2. Configure and deploy. There are two ways to provide Terraform variables:

<Tabs groupId="config-method">
  <TabItem value="deployment-conf" label="Using deployment.conf" default>

This method uses environment variables with the `TF_VAR_` prefix, which Terraform automatically recognizes.

Set AWS profile and load variables from deployment.conf:

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE="your-aws-profile"
```

```bash
set -a && source ../deployment.conf && set +a
```

Initialize Terraform:

```bash
terraform init
```

Plan the changes:

```bash
terraform plan -out=tfplan
```

Apply the changes:

```bash
terraform apply tfplan
```

Note the output for the S3 bucket (you'll need this for Phase 3):

```bash
export BACKEND_BUCKET=$(terraform output -raw terraform_states_s3_bucket_name)
echo "Backend bucket: $BACKEND_BUCKET"
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="tfvars" label="Using terraform.tfvars">

Create a `terraform.tfvars` file in the `remote-backend` directory:

```hcl
region                  = "us-east-1"
role_arn                = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/AIRunDeployerRole"  # IAM role created in Phase 1
s3_states_bucket_name   = "codemie-terraform-states"

# Optional: Custom tags
tags = {
  "SysName"     = "CodeMie"
  "Environment" = "Production"
  "Project"     = "CodeMie"
}
```

:::tip Review All Variables
Most variables have sensible defaults. Review `variables.tf` for the complete list of available configuration options.
:::

Set AWS profile:

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE="your-aws-profile"
```

Initialize and apply Terraform:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan -out=tfplan
terraform apply tfplan
```

Note the output for the S3 bucket (you'll need this for Phase 3):

```bash
export BACKEND_BUCKET=$(terraform output -raw terraform_states_s3_bucket_name)
echo "Backend bucket: $BACKEND_BUCKET"
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The created S3 bucket will be used for all subsequent infrastructure deployments.

## Phase 3: Main AWS Resources Deployment

This phase creates the following resources (see [Architecture](../architecture.md)):

- EKS Cluster
- AWS ASGs for the EKS Cluster
- AWS ALB & AWS NLB
- AWS KMS key to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data
- AWS IAM Role to access AWS KMS and Bedrock services
- AWS IAM role ExternalSecretOperator to use AWS Systems Manager
- AWS RDS Postgres
- Optionally: internal AWS ALB and private DNS hosted zone for private network connections

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://gitbud.epam.com/epm-cdme/codemie-terraform-aws-platform.git
cd codemie-terraform-aws-platform/platform
```

2. Configure and deploy. There are two ways to provide Terraform variables:

<Tabs groupId="config-method">
  <TabItem value="deployment-conf" label="Using deployment.conf" default>

This is the same method used by the `aws-terraform.sh` script. Variables are loaded as environment variables with the `TF_VAR_` prefix, which Terraform automatically recognizes.

Set AWS profile:

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE="your-aws-profile"
```

Load variables from deployment.conf (`set -a` enables auto-export of all variables):

```bash
set -a && source ../deployment.conf && set +a
```

Initialize Terraform with backend configuration:

```bash
terraform init \
  -backend-config="bucket=${BACKEND_BUCKET}" \
  -backend-config="key=${TF_VAR_region}/codemie/platform_terraform.tfstate" \
  -backend-config="region=${TF_VAR_region}" \
  -backend-config="acl=bucket-owner-full-control" \
  -backend-config="encrypt=true" \
  -backend-config="use_lockfile=true"
```

Run terraform plan:

```bash
terraform plan -out=tfplan
```

Apply the changes:

```bash
terraform apply tfplan
```

Check the outputs:

```bash
terraform output
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="tfvars" label="Using terraform.tfvars">

Create a `terraform.tfvars` file with your configuration:

```hcl
# Required: AWS Configuration
region               = "us-east-1"
role_arn             = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/AIRunDeployerRole"  # IAM role created in Phase 1
platform_domain_name = "codemie.airun.example.com"

# Required: Platform Configuration
platform_name = "codemie"
subnet_azs    = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b", "us-east-1c"]

# Required: EKS Configuration
cluster_version            = "1.35"
demand_instance_types      = [{ instance_type = "r5.xlarge" }]
demand_max_nodes_count     = 3
demand_desired_nodes_count = 3
demand_min_nodes_count     = 3

# Optional: Network Configuration
platform_cidr  = "10.0.0.0/16"
private_cidrs  = ["10.0.0.0/22", "10.0.4.0/22", "10.0.8.0/22"]
public_cidrs   = ["10.0.12.0/24", "10.0.13.0/24", "10.0.14.0/24"]

# Optional: IAM Permissions Boundary
eks_admin_role_arn            = ""
role_permissions_boundary_arn = ""

# Optional: Network Access Control
enable_private_connections = true
lb_prefix_list_ids         = []
lb_specific_ips            = []
security_group_ids         = []

# Optional: Dedicated RDS Instances Configuration
# Set enabled = true to provision a dedicated RDS instance for the service.
# All other fields are optional and fall back to defaults.
keycloak_db_config = { enabled = true }
langfuse_db_config = { enabled = false }
litellm_db_config  = { enabled = false }
```

:::tip Review All Variables
The configuration file contains many variables. Most have sensible defaults. Review `variables.tf` for the complete list of available configuration options.
:::

Set AWS profile:

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE="your-aws-profile"
```

Set region for backend configuration (Terraform doesn't read tfvars during init phase):

```bash
export REGION="us-east-1"
```

Initialize Terraform with backend configuration:

```bash
terraform init \
  -backend-config="bucket=${BACKEND_BUCKET}" \
  -backend-config="key=${REGION}/codemie/platform_terraform.tfstate" \
  -backend-config="region=${REGION}" \
  -backend-config="acl=bucket-owner-full-control" \
  -backend-config="encrypt=true" \
  -backend-config="use_lockfile=true"
```

Run terraform plan:

```bash
terraform plan -out=tfplan
```

Apply the changes:

```bash
terraform apply tfplan
```

Check the outputs:

```bash
terraform output
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::warning Security Groups
Ensure that you allowed incoming traffic to the Security Group attached to LoadBalancers from:

- Your VPN or from networks you're planning to work with AI/Run CodeMie
- EKS Cluster NAT Gateway EIP (not required if `enable_private_connections` variable is set to `true`)
  :::

This concludes AWS infrastructure deployment.

## Next Steps

After successful deployment, proceed to [Components Deployment](../components-deployment/index.md) to install AI/Run CodeMie application components.
